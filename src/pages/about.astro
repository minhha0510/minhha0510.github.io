          I'm a pharmacoepidemiologist researching medication safety, clinical outcomes, and 
          the real-world effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions. My work focuses on 
          translating complex evidence into actionable insights for patients and clinicians.

        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>
          My research sits at the intersection of pharmacology, epidemiology, and clinical medicine. 
          I specialize in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Drug safety surveillance</strong> — identifying and quantifying adverse effects of commonly prescribed medications</li>
          <li><strong>Comparative effectiveness research</strong> — evaluating which treatments work best in real-world settings</li>
          <li><strong>Methodological innovation</strong> — developing and applying rigorous epidemiologic methods to healthcare data</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence synthesis</strong> — systematic reviews and meta-analyses to integrate findings across studies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Much of my recent work has focused on 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride), 
          widely used medications for benign prostatic hyperplasia and male pattern baldness. I've investigated 
          their potential effects on depression, diabetes risk, and glycemic control using large-scale 
          observational data from the United States, South Korea, and New Zealand.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="philosophy">
        <h2>Research Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that good epidemiology requires both methodological rigor and clear communication. 
          A study can be statistically sophisticated, but if its implications aren't understood by 
          clinicians and patients, its impact is limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my work, I emphasize:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appropriate comparator selection</strong> — the control group matters enormously in observational research</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — open data, open code, and clear reporting of limitations</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical relevance</strong> — focusing on questions that matter for patient care</li>
          <li><strong>Nuanced interpretation</strong> — avoiding both alarmism and false reassurance</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I hold a Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) and am currently pursuing doctoral studies in Epidemiology 
          at Vanderbilt University. My training spans clinical pharmacy, epidemiologic methods, and 
          biostatistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've had the privilege of collaborating with researchers across multiple institutions and 
          countries, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vanderbilt University Medical Center</li>
          <li>Yonsei University College of Medicine</li>
          <li>University of Auckland</li>
          <li>University of British Columbia</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="about-blog">
        <h2>About This Blog</h2>
        <p>
          This blog serves as a bridge between academic research and broader understanding. Each post 
          explains one of my studies in accessible terms, exploring:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why the research question matters</li>
          <li>How we designed the study and why</li>
          <li>What we found and what it means</li>
          <li>The limitations and unanswered questions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also provide AI prompts for readers who want to explore the research more deeply with 
          tools like ChatGPT or Claude. These prompts are designed to facilitate nuanced discussions 
          about the methodology, findings, and implications.
        </p>
