**ABSTRACT**

**Background**: There is a high correlation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence has been conflicted on the effect of BPH medications on glucose homeostasis. This study examined the risk of poor glycemic control associated with the use of finasteride and tamsulosin in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

**Methods: **We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a new-user, active-comparator design using nationwide pharmaceutical dispensing and hospitalization databases in New Zealand. The study cohort was comprised of men with type 2 diabetes who were taking finasteride (n=1,259) or tamsulosin (n=580). Inverse probability treatment weighting using propensity score was applied to create a weighted population with balanced baseline covariates. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to estimate the risk.

**Results:** During a median follow-up of 2.4 years for finasteride users and 1.6 years for tamsulosin users, incidence rates were 564 per 10,000 person-years and 409 per 10,000 person-years in tamsulosin users and finasteride users, respectively. After applying inverse probability treatment weighting, tamsulosin users were not at a significantly higher risk of poor glycemic control compared with finasteride users (weighted hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.72). Sensitivity analyses to address confounding and protopathic bias showed similar risks.

**Conclusions:** We found that there was a non-differential risk of poor glycemic control between tamsulosin users and finasteride users over long-term usage.

**INTRODUCTION**

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common urological problems in men. The global prevalence of BPH increased from 51.1 million cases in 2000 to 94 million cases in 2019. In addition, its heavy burden is also projected to increase [1], which emphasizing the need for an effective management strategy for this condition. Recent studies have shown an association of prostate enlargement with elevated fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels [2,3], which may be explained by biological mechanisms, including sex steroid metabolism, systematic inflammation, and insulin-like growth factor activity [4]. Two large, high-quality studies [5,6] and a meta-analysis [7] have linked hyperglycemia to more severe lower urinary tract symptoms in BPH patients. Given the consequence of the link between prostate enlargement and glucose metabolism, glycemic status is an important factor to consider in BPH management.

Studies have explored the effect of BPH medications on glucose metabolism; however, their findings are mixed. An animal study found 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARis) influenced glucocorticoid metabolism by reducing the levels of androgen dihydrotestosterone, consequently inducing steatotic liver disease and hepatic insulin resistance [8]. Similar effects have been observed in humans. For example, a meta-analysis reported an association between androgen deprivation therapy and increased risk of diabetes mellitus [9]. A randomized controlled study involving 46 BPH patients found a decrease in hepatic insulin sensitivity among BPH patients on dutasteride, a 5-ARi [10]. The same mixed findings also appeared in investigations involving the alpha-blocker drug class. A single-arm clinical trial found favorable effects of doxazosin, a non-specific alpha-blocker, on glycemic control in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [11]. Conversely, a recent case series showed tamsulosin, a uroselective alpha-blocker, may induce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM [12,13]. These inconsistent findings underscore the need for further investigation by large-scale pharmaco-epidemiological studies. Two such studies have been published, though they produced conflicting results despite using similar databases [14,15]. Both studies compared the risk of developing T2DM in BPH patients who took 5-ARis versus those who did not. The earlier study, which drew data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, found finasteride—a 5-ARi—decreased the risk of developing T2DM [14]. By contrast, the latter study, which utilized both the National Health Insurance Research Database and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, showed finasteride increased the risk of T2DM [15]. Notably, neither study used a lag period to address protopathic bias, which refers to reverse associations between drug exposure and development of a disease or condition.

Furthermore, it remains unclear whether BPH medications impact glycemic control in patients with T2DM. To date, no real-world pharmaco-epidemiological study has been conducted to compare the effects of finasteride and tamsulosin use on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. This nationwide population-based cohort study aimed to compare the incidence of poor glycemic control between finasteride and tamsulosin users with T2DM.
