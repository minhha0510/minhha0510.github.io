**ABSTRACT**

**PURPOSE**

Recent large-scale studies have investigated the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) associated with the use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients, but heterogeneous findings have been reported. This study aimed to examine the risk of T2DM associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) compared to tamsulosin.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

We identified nationwide cohorts of new users of finasteride, dutasteride, and tamsulosin without a history of prescriptions for 5-ARIs or tamsulosin within the previous 3 years among patients covered by national health insurance between 2010 to 2020 in South Korea. Patients were free of T2DM and had received at least 90 days of dispensation of the medications. We balanced cohorts on risk factors for T2DM based on age, health insurance status, index year, comorbidities, and co-medications using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, with censoring for treatment discontinuation, switching, or augmentation, end of enrollment, and death.

**RESULTS**

A total of 34,874 tamsulosin users, 16,953 finasteride users, and 19,480 dutasteride users were included. The adjusted HR for finasteride was 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.11) and that for dutasteride was 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.02), when compared with tamsulosin users. These estimates were consistent in lag time analyses and attenuated among patients with good compliance.

**CONCLUSION**

This study suggests minimal effects of finasteride and dutasteride on the risk of T2DM when compared with tamsulosin among patients with BPH.

**INTRODUCTION**

Finasteride and dutasteride, both 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), are widely used medications for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In the UK alone, it is estimated that there are 3,600,000 prescriptions for finasteride annually1. Although initially demonstrated to be safe and efficacious through clinical trials2–4, post-marketing authorization studies have recently emerged highlighting a wide range of side effects associated with 5-ARIs. These side effects range from well-recognized problems such as sexual dysfunction5,6 to more recently recognized neuropsychiatric symptoms7 and metabolic disturbances8 associated with long-term use of finasteride. Given the widespread use of these medications, these novel side effects need to be thoroughly investigated to avoid a potential public health hazard.

Multiple epidemiological studies have examined the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in patients taking 5-ARIs8–10, particularly finasteride and dutasteride. This relation was examined because accumulated in vitro observations and small clinical trials have suggested that inhibition of 5-alpha reductase enzymes in men may increase the risk of T2DM by promoting body fat accumulation, reducing insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue via suppression of non-esterified fatty acids, and contributing to liver steatosis11. Nevertheless, the results of epidemiological studies have been heterogeneous, possibly due to methodological differences8–10. For example, a report by Lee *et al*. estimated the risk of new-onset T2DM at approximately 0.72 when comparing 5-ARIs users and non-users in the Taiwanese data9. Using the same database, Wei *et al. *reported a 49% higher risk of new-onset T2DM in 5-ARIs users compared with tamsulosin users8. Methodologically, the earlier study used a non-active comparator, which is susceptible to confounding by indication and healthy user bias. Although the later study used an active comparator (i.e., tamsulosin users), the authors did not mention a specific washout period, which might have introduced prevalent users into the new-user groups. If the effects of 5-ARIs were dose-dependent, including prevalent users could inflate the risk of developing T2DM. Given the popularity and long-term use of 5-ARIs to manage these conditions, their safety is an issue of great interest for both clinical practice and public health.

Therefore, there remains a need for large pharmacoepidemiologic studies with robust methods to replicate previous findings. We aimed to examine the risk of developing T2DM in BPH patients who initiated finasteride/dutasteride monotherapy in comparison to tamsulosin monotherapy based on a large-scale historical cohort of 5-ARIs new users in South Korea.
