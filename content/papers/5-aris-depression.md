**ABSTRACT**

**Introduction**

The link between 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) and depression has raised concerns due to the widespread and prolonged use. Previous studies and meta-analyses reported inconsistent results without clear explanations for the heterogeneity. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the depression risk associated with 5-ARIs and evaluate how control group selection contributes to the heterogeneity of reported results.

**Methods**

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on articles from Scopus, Embase, and MEDLINE. The search was performed from database inception to January 2025. 

**Results**

Five longitudinal studies (n= 2,517,859 patients, effect size = 8), across a wide range of populations (US, UK, Cananda, South Korea) and time-period (1992 – 2018) were included 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors use was associated with a 31% increased risk of depression (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.98–1.76), with high heterogeneity (I² = 95.5%, τ2 = 0.0984, P < 0.0001). When stratified by comparator type, studies using non-drug controls reported significantly elevated risk (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.20–2.16, I² = 94.4%, τ2 = 0.0635, P < 0.0001), while those using alpha-blocker comparators showed decreased risk (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.86–0.92, I² = 0%, τ2 = 0, P = 0.9711). The choice of comparator group explained the most heterogeneity across studies while the type of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors showed similar results.

**Conclusions**

The risk of depression with 5-ARI use is likely minimal. Observational data utilizing active comparators suggests a 10% reduction in risk, while randomized data from a cancer prevention trial suggests a potential risk increase of approximately 10%. Previous reports of up to 200% increased risk likely stem from inappropriate control group selection that failed to account for disease burden.

**Plain language summary:**

Some studies overstated the risk of depression associated with commonly prescribed prostate medications (finasteride and dutasteride) in men over age 50 with an enlarged prostate. This overstatement was due to how comparison groups were selected. Doctors should not be overly concerned about depression risk when deciding whether to prescribe these medications.**INTRODUCTION**

5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), such as finasteride and dutasteride, are commonly prescribed for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and androgenetic alopecia (AGA). These medications are used by millions of men annually, with finasteride prescribed to approximately 2.6 million men in the United States in 2022[1]. Due to their long-term use in these chronic conditions, there is growing interest in understanding their potential adverse effects, including impacts on mental health.

The proposed mechanism linking 5-ARIs to mood disturbances involves inhibition of the conversion of progesterone to dihydroprogestrone (DHP) in the neurosteroid pathway by 5α-reductase. DHP is subsequently metabolized to produce allopregnanolone, acting as a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, exerting anxiolytic and mood-stabilizing effects[2,3]. However, the literature presents conflicting findings on the relationship between 5-ARIs and depression. Early studies, such as Irwig et al., suggested an association between finasteride use and depressive symptoms post therapy[4], often termed "post-finasteride syndrome" (PFS), in men treated for AGA. The study was conducted among a subset of 61 men with persistent sexual side effects with self-administrative questionnaire, limiting the generalizability of these findings due to self-selection bias.

Larger cohort studies have since been conducted, producing heterogeneous results[5–9].  Previous meta-analyses[10,11] reported non-significant pooled results but did not give a sufficient explanation for the observed heterogeneity.  To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis examining how control group selection contributes to heterogeneity in the reported association between 5-ARI use and depression risk. We also provide recommendations for selecting an appropriate control group, depending on study design and research questions.

**METHODS**

**Search Strategy and Study Eligibility**

The meta-analysis followed a PROSPERO registered protocol. Two independent reviewers systematically evaluated eligibility of all studies retrieved from Scopus, Embase, and MEDLINE for human studies evaluating depression risk associated with 5-ARI usage from inception to January 2025. We screened the reference lists of the articles and where possible, corresponded with study investigators. Full details of the search strategy are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement materials. References identified from database searches were exported to Covidence. Studies presented as abstracts, case reports, conference proceedings, reviews, animal experiments or duplicate publications were excluded. Studies with insufficient data or inadequate reporting and non-English language studies were also excluded. Each full-text article was assessed independently for final inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

 

**Data Extraction and Quality Assessment**

Two reviewers independently extracted the following data from each article using a standardized study form: (1) study information – authors, year publication, geographic location, research design, database usage (2) characteristics of participants – mean age, number of exposure, definition of exposure, number of control, definition of control, baseline ascertainment period, mean/median follow-up time, baseline covariates assessment, grace/continuity period, statistical method to control for confounders, and (3) ascertainment of depressive outcomes (number and type of sources of ascertainment). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with studies scoring ≥7 considered high quality. The rationale for the given scores is on eTable 2 of the supplementary materials.  All statistical codes and data will be made publicly available upon publication to promote transparency and reproducibility. The PRSIMA flow chart is given in Figure 1.

**Statistical Analysis**

The primary effect measure was the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Odds ratios were treated as HRs given the low incidence of depression. When multiple HRs were reported due to violation of PH, the larger HR was selected conservatively. 

A random-effects model was used to pool effect sizes, with between-study variance (τ²) estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird method[12].  The Hartung-Knapp adjustment[13] was applied to account for the small number of studies (n=8 effect sizes), improving the robustness of confidence intervals. A random-effects model was selected *a priori* to account for expected clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies, including differences in populations, study designs, and outcome definitions. Between-study heterogeneity[14] was assessed using the I² statistic and Cochran's Q test. I² values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered to represent low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively. 

We specified an *a priori* objective to stratify analyses by control group type (active comparator vs. non-drug users) and 5-ARI agents. Stratification by control group was motivated by literature in pharmacoepidemiology studies[15–17] and stratification by 5-ARI agents was motivated by the difference in molecular weight between dutasteride and finasteride. Dutasteride has larger molecular weight than finasteride 528.539 g/mol-1 vs 372.553 g/mol-1)[18,19], which may limit its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and exert central neurological effects.

We performed leave-one-out meta-analyses to evaluate the influence of individuals. Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection of funnel plots and formally tested using Egger's test[20]. 

All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the 'meta', 'netmeta', and 'metafor' packages. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05 (two-sided).

**Public and patient involvement**

No patients or members of the public were directly involved in this study as no primary data was collected. 

**RESULTS**

**Study Characteristics**

Five studies involving a total of 2,517,859 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis (Table 1). These five studies provide eight effect sizes: Garcia-Argibay 2022 (finasteride and dutasteride)[5], Yeon 2022 (combined 5-ARIs) [6], Hagberg 2017 (finasteride and dutasteride) [7], Welk 2017 (finasteride and dutasteride) [8], and Unger 2016 (finasteride)[9]. All were cohort studies, with the exception of Unger et al., which was derived from a preventive randomized controlled trial (RCT). Their NOS scores are given in Table 2.

Three of the cohort studies[6–8] employed a 1–2-year look-back period to minimize prevalent user bias. Most studies included men aged at least 50 years or older, except for Hagberg et al[7], which included younger participants. The studies were conducted across diverse geographical locations, including Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and South Korea.

**Associations between 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and depressive symptoms**

The pooled analysis estimated a 31% increased risk of depression associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor usage, HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.98 – 1.76 (Figure 2). However, this overall estimate was accompanied by substantial heterogeneity across studies (I² = 95.5%, τ2 = 0.0984, P < 0.0001), indicating considerable variability in treatment effects. There were no significant differences in depression risk between finasteride and dutasteride users - Finasteride HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.51–3.72, I² = 97.4%, τ2 = 0.1541, P < 0.0001 vs Dutasteride HR 1.45, 95% CI 0.51–4.10, I² = 96%, τ2 = 0.1688, P < 0.0001 (Figure 3).

The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis provided pooled HR ranging from 1.23 to 1.36 with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) spanning from 0.90 to 1.90 (eTable 1). These remained stable and consistent with the original pooled HR of 1.31 (95% CI 0.98 – 1.76), indicating no significant influence from any single study. The persistent high heterogeneity (I² 94.4% to 96.05%, τ² 0.0809 to 0.1164) aligns with the original analysis (I² = 95.5%, τ² = 0.0984, P < 0.0001), suggesting that variability is not driven by an outlier but rather by study-level differences. 

**Associations stratified by control groups**

When stratified by control group (Figure 4 - excluding the Unger et al. RCT), observational studies comparing 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) to non-drug users showed a significantly increased risk of depression with moderate heterogeneity (HR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.50 - 2.07, I² = 57.7%, τ2 = 0.0635, P < 0.0001). In contrast, studies using active comparator (alpha-blocker/tamsulosin) showed a decreased risk (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.86 – 0.92) with minimal indication for heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 0%, τ2 = 0, p = 0.9711). 

**Publication bias**

A funnel plot was generated to assess publication bias (Figure 5). Visual inspection revealed potential asymmetry, with more studies reporting hazard ratios greater than 1 (suggesting increased depression risk with 5-ARIs) and fewer studies with hazard ratios less than 1, particularly among those with smaller standard errors. Egger’s test for small-study effects could not be reliably performed due to the small number of effect sizes (k=8), as the test requires a minimum of 10 studies for adequate power. The observed asymmetry may reflect underlying heterogeneity rather than true publication bias. Nevertheless, this pattern suggests a possible tilt in the evidence toward mild or null effect, as studies with negative results may be underrepresented in the published literature.

**DISCUSSION**

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 longitudinal studies involving 2,517,859 patients demonstrated that 5-ARI users had a significantly increased risk of depression compared to non-drug users (HR = 1.61, 95% CI, 1.20 – 2.16) while a decreased risk was observed when compared to alpha blocker users (HR = 0.89, 95% CI, 0.86 – 0.92). In addition, when using alpha blocker users as a control group, the pooled HR had little indication for heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, τ2 = 0, p = 0.9711). Given that most participants in this meta-analysis were aged 50 or older and diagnosed with BPH, alpha-blocker users represent a more appropriate control group than non-drug users, as they better account for the underlying disease burden and age-related risk factors.

When investigating side effects related to a drug that is used to treat an active disease, in this case 5-ARIs for active BPH treatment- it is more appropriate to compare against patients receiving other treatments for the same condition (i.e. active comparator[16]). Making comparison against patients with the disease but not taking the medication opens the door for biases by disease burden/indication. For instance, Rahimi-Ardabili et al. [21] observed increased depressive symptoms in patients treated with finasteride; however, the study's single-arm design makes it difficult to determine whether these symptoms arose from the medication or the psychological distress associated with the underlying condition itself. This limitation underscores the necessity of active-comparator designs, which ensure that both groups share a similar disease burden. As demonstrated by the supplementary data from the appendix of Garcia-Argibay et al[5], the risks of depression were lower/non-significant when comparing 5-ARI usage against record AB usage (Finasteride HR 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73 – 0.91) and Dutasteride HR 0.86 (95% CI, 0.70 – 1.02); while the main analysis pointed toward an increased risk of depression associated with record 5-ARIs when comparing to non-drug users (Finasteride HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.47 – 1.76 and Dutasteride HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.43 – 1.97). 

This consistency across studies suggests that 5-ARIs likely do not substantially increase depression risk when accounting for underlying disease burden.  The use of an active-comparator design helps mitigate confounding by indication, as both groups share similar treatment indications (e.g., BPH), thereby reducing bias from unmeasured confounders such as disease severity or treatment-seeking behavior.

Our study further showed that even with propensity score matching, findings of observational treatment studies using non-drug control groups are likely subject to confounding by indication.  This is in-line with previous methodological studies have shown that observational design could replicate RCT results in preventive trials involving healthy populations, but fail to do so in treatment trials where the populations had high degree of disease burden [17,22,23]. 

The substantial disease burden associated with BPH was highlighted in the cross-sectional study by Pietrzyk et al[24], which documented a wide spectrum of BPH-related morbidity.  We did not include estimates from Pietrzyk et al in our analysis due to challenges in interpretation and concerns regarding methodological limitations.  Specifically, the use of stepwise selection procedures for covariates may have inflated the risk of Type I error and compromised the validity of statistical inferences.

In this context of high disease burden, the Unger et al. [9] study warrants distinct consideration. Unlike the observational cohorts which examined patients receiving treatment for established disease, Unger et al. was a prevention trial conducted in men without prevalent BPH. Consequently, it is inherently less susceptible to confounding by indication, as participants were not selected based on disease severity or treatment-seeking behavior.

However, while the study design mitigates confounding, the statistical interpretation requires caution. As a secondary analysis of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, Unger et al. evaluated 20 distinct outcomes. The observed association with depression (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01–1.19, P = .04) was not adjusted for multiple comparisons; standard adjustment would likely render this result non-significant. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory.

When comparing this prevention trial evidence to our active-comparator results, a nuanced picture emerges. The protective effect observed in our observational active-comparator analysis (pooled HR 0.89) may reflect residual confounding in the opposite direction—specifically, patients prescribed alpha-blockers often require more frequent clinical contact, due to acute symptoms, than those on 5-ARIs, thereby increasing opportunities for depression diagnosis.

Given these considerations, we interpret the Unger point estimate (HR 1.10) as potentially the closest approximation to the isolated pharmacological effect of 5-ARIs, free from the confounding of disease burden found in non-user studies and the potential detection bias of active-comparator studies. The modest magnitude of this effect supports our conclusion that any depression risk associated with 5-ARIs is likely minimal.

**CONCLUSION**

Taken together, these findings indicate that while 5-ARIs may exert some biological effect on mood—potentially through mechanisms like neuro-steroid modulation—the impact on depression incidence appears to be much smaller than previously reported. 

The risk of depression associated with 5-ARI use for BPH in men aged 50 and older is likely minimal and should not substantially influence prescribing decisions. Observational data with active comparators suggest a 10% reduction in risk, while randomized data from a cancer prevention trial suggest a potential risk increase of approximately 10%. The inflated risk (around 200%) observed in literature stems from inappropriate control group selection in observational studies. Non-user control groups introduce protopathic bias due to differential underlying disease burden, even when propensity score matching is applied. Future studies investigating depression risk in the AGA populations, especially younger ones, should prioritize active comparator designs to mitigate confounding by indication.
