**ABSTRACT**

**Background**: There is a high correlation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence has been conflicted on the effect of BPH medications on glucose homeostasis. This study examined the risk of poor glycemic control associated with the use of finasteride and tamsulosin in individuals with type 2 diabetes. 

**Methods: **We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a new-user, active-comparator design using nationwide pharmaceutical dispensing and hospitalization databases in New Zealand. The study cohort was comprised of men with type 2 diabetes who were taking finasteride (n=1,259) or tamsulosin (n=580). Inverse probability treatment weighting using propensity score was applied to create a weighted population with balanced baseline covariates. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to estimate the risk.

**Results:** During a median follow-up of 2.4 years for finasteride users and 1.6 years for tamsulosin users, incidence rates were 564 per 10,000 person-years and 409 per 10,000 person-years in tamsulosin users and finasteride users, respectively. After applying inverse probability treatment weighting, tamsulosin users were not at a significantly higher risk of poor glycemic control compared with finasteride users (weighted hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.72). Sensitivity analyses to address confounding and protopathic bias showed similar risks. 

**Conclusions:** We found that there was a non-differential risk of poor glycemic control between tamsulosin users and finasteride users over long-term usage.

**INTRODUCTION**

# Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common urological problems in men. The global prevalence of BPH increased from 51.1 million cases in 2000 to 94 million cases in 2019. In addition, its heavy burden is also projected to increase [1], which emphasizing the need for an effective management strategy for this condition. Recent studies have shown an association of prostate enlargement with elevated fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels [2,3], which may be explained by biological mechanisms, including sex steroid metabolism, systematic inflammation, and insulin-like growth factor activity [4]. Two large, high-quality studies [5,6] and a meta-analysis [7] have linked hyperglycemia to more severe lower urinary tract symptoms in BPH patients. Given the consequence of the link between prostate enlargement and glucose metabolism, glycemic status is an important factor to consider in BPH management.

# Studies have explored the effect of BPH medications on glucose metabolism; however, their findings are mixed. An animal study found 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARis) influenced glucocorticoid metabolism by reducing the levels of androgen dihydrotestosterone, consequently inducing steatotic liver disease and hepatic insulin resistance [8]. Similar effects have been observed in humans. For example, a meta-analysis reported an association between androgen deprivation therapy and increased risk of diabetes mellitus [9]. A randomized controlled study involving 46 BPH patients found a decrease in hepatic insulin sensitivity among BPH patients on dutasteride, a 5-ARi [10]. The same mixed findings also appeared in investigations involving the alpha-blocker drug class. A single-arm clinical trial found favorable effects of doxazosin, a non-specific alpha-blocker, on glycemic control in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [11]. Conversely, a recent case series showed tamsulosin, a uroselective alpha-blocker, may induce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM [12,13]. These inconsistent findings underscore the need for further investigation by large-scale pharmaco-epidemiological studies. Two such studies have been published, though they produced conflicting results despite using similar databases [14,15]. Both studies compared the risk of developing T2DM in BPH patients who took 5-ARis versus those who did not. The earlier study, which drew data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, found finasteride—a 5-ARi—decreased the risk of developing T2DM [14]. By contrast, the latter study, which utilized both the National Health Insurance Research Database and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, showed finasteride increased the risk of T2DM [15]. Notably, neither study used a lag period to address protopathic bias, which refers to reverse associations between drug exposure and development of a disease or condition. 

# Furthermore, it remains unclear whether BPH medications impact glycemic control in patients with T2DM. To date, no real-world pharmaco-epidemiological study has been conducted to compare the effects of finasteride and tamsulosin use on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. This nationwide population-based cohort study aimed to compare the incidence of poor glycemic control between finasteride and tamsulosin users with T2DM.

**PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS**

**Data source**

All data were sourced from the New Zealand Ministry of Health national collections between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2017. Information on demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity), diagnosis date, and diagnosis code (based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, tenth edition [ICD-10]) was sourced from the National Minimum Dataset (hospital event data) [16]. The hospital event data were then linked with Pharmaceutical Dispensing data, which contains claim and payment information from pharmacists, and mortality data using the encrypted National Health Index number—a unique identifier assigned to every person who utilizes health and disability services in New Zealand. 

**Study cohort**

We used an active-comparator, new-user design to construct a cohort of men who were admitted for T2DM (ICD-10, E11) and then received either tamsulosin or finasteride treatment (Figure 1). To increase the likelihood that selected patients indeed had T2DM, we further restricted our cohort to those who received at least 1 prescription for any oral diabetic medications during the study period following their admission with T2DM. Our search algorithm includes all nationally insured oral diabetic medications in New Zealand during the study period, which are metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, pioglitazone and acarbose. To identify new-user of the interest drugs, a 2-year wash-out period was applied, and patients required to have at least of 1-year of record pharmaceutical dispensing data to enter the study. For a head-to-head comparison between finasteride monotherapy and tamsulosin monotherapy, we identified the first date of the finasteride or tamsulosin prescription (set as the index date) after 31 December 2007. We excluded 1) patients who had ICD-10 codes for other types of diabetes ( E10, E12, E13, and E14), 2) patients who received an insulin prescription prior to the index date, 3) patients who switched from finasteride to tamsulosin or vice versa, 4) patients who received both tamsulosin and finasteride during the follow-up period, 5) patients with any cancer diagnosis during the study duration using relevant ICD-10 codes (C00–C97), and 6) patients who received fewer than three prescriptions for tamsulosin or finasteride. 

**Outcome and covariates**

The outcome was the first insulin prescription, as a proxy for poor glycemic control [17], during the follow-up period. Follow-up ended at the occurrence of the outcome, death, or 31 December 2017, whichever came first. We considered the following potential confounders: age at the index date, ethnicity, T2DM’s medications (our patients only have record for metformin and sulfonylurea), duration of T2DM (from the first record of T2DM in the database to the index date), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI; using ICD-10 codes in the 5 years prior to the index date), and use of other drugs affecting glycemic control, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics, statins, and beta-blockers. In New Zealand, T2DM patients of some ethnicities have been reported to have poorer health outcomes than the majority ethnicity [18,19]. The ethnic groups were categorized as Europeans, Indigenous people, Asians, and Others (including not recorded) based on the codes provided by the New Zealand health ministry [20]. The baseline covariates were taken within one year prior to the index date unless stated otherwise. 

**Statistical analyses**

***Main analysis***

A log-rank test was conducted to investigate the significance of the difference in the probability of poor glycemic control between finasteride and tamsulosin users during the follow-up period. A Kaplan-Meier curve was fitted on the unweighted population. We first estimated the crude hazard ratio between tamsulosin and finasteride, without any covariates. A 95% confidence interval was used to account for uncertainty of the estimates and absolute difference less than 0.1 is deemed as suitable. Subsequently, we built a Cox proportional hazard model including the above covariates (age at the index date, ethnicity, T2DM’s medications, duration of T2DM, CCI, and use of ACEis, ARBs, diuretics, statins, and beta-blockers) and estimated adjusted hazard ratio (adjusted HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The follow-up time for each patient was calculated as the time from the index date to the end of the follow-up period. The proportionality assumptions were not violated based on Schoenfeld proportionality tests. To address indication bias, we conducted inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW). We first constructed a logistic regression model to obtain a propensity score for each patient using the same covariates in the adjusted HR; and then applied IPTW using the propensity scores to create a weighted population with balanced covariates. Extreme weights were removed with 1% and 99% quantile weight trimming. We evaluated baseline covariates using the absolute standardized difference, cumulative distribution functions, and box plots (Figures S1–3). Absolute standardized differences smaller than 0.10 were considered acceptable [21]. A Cox proportional hazard model was fitted after IPTW without including any covariates. Statistical analyses were carried out using Python 3.9.12 and RStudio (4.3.2).

***Sensitivity analysis***

We conducted two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. First, to address protopathic bias and indication bias, we performed a delayed event analysis with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month lag periods. These lag periods were chosen because 5-ARis may disrupt glucose metabolism between 3 weeks and 3 months from initiation [10,22]. In addition, given the uncertainties in the time between worsening glycemic control and the first insulin prescription, we extended the exposure lag period to 12 months. This 12-month lag period was chosen because an average of 1 year can elapse before providers intensify treatment for patients with poor glycemic control [23]. Patients displaying the event of interest before the lag periods were likely influenced by protopathic bias. In the context of protopathic bias, tamsulosin is often used to manage frequent micturition [24,25], which could signal worsening of underlying diabetic symptoms. In this analysis, patients who received insulin during the lag periods were re-classified as non-event.

For the second sensitivity analysis, considering that patients with multiple comorbidities are more likely to receive insulin for glycemic control [26], the cohort was stratified into a low CCI stratum (i.e., patients with lower than or equal to the median CCI score of 9.0) and a high CCI stratum (i.e., patients with a CCI score higher than the median). Subsequently, IPTW using propensity score was applied as detailed above to create pseudo-population; and Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to estimate a weighted HR for each stratum. All sensitivity analyses were carried out using pseudo-population.

**ETHICS AND CONSENT **

Ethics approval was waived because we obtained de-identified raw data from New Zealand Ministry of Health national collections for research purpose (https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/for-health-professionals/data-and-statistics/nz-health-statistics/national-collections-and-surveys/collections/national-minimum-dataset-hospital-events). This study using secondary data and thus did not require informed consent from individual patients. There was no data for people under 18 years old in this study.

**RESULTS**

**Characteristics of the study cohort**

We identified 1,259 finasteride users and 580 tamsulosin users among 228,163 patients with T2DM. At baseline, the tamsulosin group had a lower mean CCI score, and was more likely to use ARBs and statin while less likely to use ACEis, compared with the finasteride group (Table 1). After applying IPTW, all the absolute standardized differences in covariates were less than 0.10.

**Risk of poor glycemic control in tamsulosin versus finasteride users**

During a median follow-up of 2.44 years for finasteride users and 1.61 years for tamsulosin users, we noted 221 new insulin prescriptions (154 finasteride users and 67 tamsulosin users). The incidence rates were 564 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI, 429–700) and 409 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI, 344–474) in tamsulosin users and finasteride users, respectively (Table 2). The free-insulin prescription probability was lower in the tamsulosin cohort compared with the finasteride cohort (p = 0.068 from the log-rank test). The curve showed a rapid divergence after treatment initiation (Figure 2). Tamsulosin users had a higher insulin prescription rate compared with finasteride users, although this increased risk was not statistically significant (adjusted HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.92–1.66). After IPTW, a similar risk of receiving an insulin prescription was observed in tamsulosin users versus finasteride users (weighted HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.95–1.72).

**Sensitivity analyses**

With each successive application of lag periods, the risk of receiving an insulin prescription associated with tamsulosin monotherapy versus finasteride monotherapy gradually decreased. In weighted populations, the risks of receiving an insulin prescription were 24%, 26%, 23%, and 15% higher in tamsulosin users compared with finasteride users when applying 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month lag periods, respectively (Table S1). The risks were not statistically significant. In the CCI-stratified analyses, the insulin prescription risks associated with tamsulosin monotherapy versus finasteride monotherapy were elevated by 34% and 20% for the lower stratum and higher stratum, respectively (Figure 3; Table S2). 

**DISCUSSION**

This nationwide population-based cohort study estimated the risk of insulin prescription (as a proxy for poor glycemic control) in tamsulosin users compared with finasteride users among individuals with T2DM. While there are controversies surrounding the relationship between 5-ARis and the heightened risk of T2DM, our study adds to current evidence on the effect of BPH medication on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. In our main analysis, tamsulosin users were at a higher risk of poor glycemic control compared with finasteride users (HR=1.23), but this risk did not reach statistical significance. Additional analyses addressing indication bias (IPTW using propensity scores) and protopathic bias (applying lag periods at 3-month intervals, ranging from 3 to 12 months) demonstrated similar risks.

Considered alongside the previous findings, our results suggest the effect of BPH medications on glycemic control may be dynamic with various pathways. Although earlier studies have not unequivocally established the causality between 5-ARis and worsening glycemic control (leading to the development of T2DM), a considerable body of evidence suggests use of 5-ARis may reduce insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic individuals via steatotic liver disease [8–10,15]. The persistent trend of elevation of insulin prescription risk in the tamsulosin group in the present study suggests tamsulosin might contribute to the worsening of glycemic control in patients with established T2DM. Studies on non-insulin-dependent glucose metabolism pathways in human adipose tissue [27,28] have shown inhibition of alpha receptors (by alpha receptor blockers) decreases glucose uptake and therefore worsens glycemic control. In the present study, the hazard rate of poor glycemic control was higher in tamsulosin users than that in finasteride users, among individuals with T2DM. The possibility that tamsulosin exacerbate glycemic control in T2DM patients with excess adipose tissue appeared in a few case reports. Four T2DM patients with well-controlled blood glucose developed hyperglycemia within 48 hours of taking tamsulosin; the patients’ blood glucose levels more than doubled after tamsulosin initiation and decreased to normal levels after discontinuing tamsulosin, and all other possible causes of hyperglycemia were ruled out [13]. 

The present study may have clinical implications regarding the use of BPH medications in patients with T2DM. Previous real-world evidence from the UK and Canada suggests 5-ARi users may increase the risk of developing T2DM compared with tamsulosin users in BPH patients with normoglycemia [15,29]. It should note that the latter study did not found a dose-response relationship in 5-ARi users [29].  In this study, the results demonstrated no significant difference in the risk of poor glycemic control between finasteride users and tamsulosin users, with increasing following up time, among patients with T2DM. This suggesting that 5-ARis and tamsulosin may not differentially affect glycemia after T2DM develops. We attempted to address the indication bias due to the different patient characteristics related to finasteride and tamsulosin prescriptions using IPTW with propensity scores, which yielded similar risks. One could also argue that protopathic bias or reverse causation may affect the risk of receiving an insulin prescription in the tamsulosin group versus the finasteride group. However, our additional analyses using 3- to 12-month lag periods, with 3-month intervals, displayed similar risk estimates. Furthermore, the effect of protopathic bias may be minimal because poor glycemic status exacerbates BPH [30,31] and patients with severe BPH are more likely to receive finasteride over tamsulosin. Hence, our findings suggest that, over the long-term in T2DM patients, finasteride users may not experience more hyperglycemia episodes than if they’d had been put on tamsulosin. However, there could be an elevation of risk during the initial phase of tamsulosin in new users with T2DM.

This study has several limitations to be acknowledged. First, first prescription of insulin was used as a surrogate endpoint for poor glycemic control. This approach may have underestimated the number of individuals with poor glycemic control because it did not consider changing the regimen from monotherapy of metformin to combination therapy with other oral anti-diabetic medications as poor glycemic control. During the study period from 2006 to 2017, relatively new oral anti-diabetic medications (e.g., dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) were not introduced or publicly funded in New Zealand. Insulin has been recommended as an initial treatment for severe hyperglycemia and a third-line treatment for uncontrolled T2DM after combination therapy [35]. Because these indications of insulin prescriptions are based on the level of hemoglobin A1c, insulin use may be a useful proxy for poor glycemic control in studies using pharmaceutical dispensing data. Second, we used hospital discharge data to identify individuals with T2DM. This means that we captured more severe cases of T2DM, possibly with comorbidities. To address the potential effect of comorbidity on the studied associations, we estimated the risk of receiving an insulin prescription associated with tamsulosin use versus finasteride use after stratification by CCI score. The risk remained elevated in both the low and high strata of CCI score. Fourth, there may be unmeasured confounders. For example, we did not include other possible hyperglycemia-inducing drugs (such as corticosteroids, second-generation antipsychotics, protease inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors) in the study because our patients did not have a record (protease inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors) or a very small number of patients were on them (second-generation antipsychotic and corticosteroids). Another example is socioeconomic status, as low socioeconomic status is associated with more severe symptoms of BPH [32] as well as poor glycemic control [33,34]. Although we used ethnicity as a covariate to control for socioeconomic status, the social deprivation index may be useful as another covariate to include in the model. Lastly, the prescription data only included drugs publicly funded in New Zealand. Our study cohort started from 2008 to the end of 2017. Although tamsulosin was not publicly funded until August 2010, we applied the same time period to the finasteride and tamsulosin cohorts (from January 2008). This may not have distorted our results as we used the dynamic cohort design

In conclusion, the present study showed that finasteride users and tamsulosin users had similar risks of poor glycemic control with long-term usage of these drugs among individuals with T2DM.  Nevertheless, there could be an increased risk during initiation of tamsulosin in BPH-treatment naïve patients with T2DM. Further studies with longer follow-up time and larger sample size are required to confirm these associations.
