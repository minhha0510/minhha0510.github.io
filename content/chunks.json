    "text": "Paper: 5 ARIs Depression\nSection: ABSTRACT\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe link between 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) and depression has raised concerns due to the widespread and prolonged use. Previous studies and meta-analyses reported inconsistent results without clear explanations for the heterogeneity. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the depression risk associated with 5-ARIs and evaluate how control group selection contributes to the heterogeneity of reported results.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on articles from Scopus, Embase, and MEDLINE. The search was performed from database inception to January 2025. \n\n**Results**\n\nFive longitudinal studies (n= 2,517,859 patients, effect size = 8), across a wide range of populations (US, UK, Cananda, South Korea) and time-period (1992 – 2018) were included 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors use was associated with a 31% increased risk of depression (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.98–1.76), with high heterogeneity (I² = 95.5%, τ2 = 0.0984, P < 0.0001). When stratified by comparator type, studies using non-drug controls reported significantly elevated risk (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.20–2.16, I² = 94.4%, τ2 = 0.0635, P < 0.0001), while those using alpha-blocker comparators showed decreased risk (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.86–0.92, I² = 0%, τ2 = 0, P = 0.9711). The choice of comparator group explained the most heterogeneity across studies while the type of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors showed similar results.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nThe risk of depression with 5-ARI use is likely minimal. Observational data utilizing active comparators suggests a 10% reduction in risk, while randomized data from a cancer prevention trial suggests a potential risk increase of approximately 10%. Previous reports of up to 200% increased risk likely stem from inappropriate control group selection that failed to account for disease burden.\n\n**Keywords**: 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, depression, pharmacoepidemiology, finasteride, dutasteride, active-comparator, meta-analysis\n\n**Plain language summary:**\n\nSome studies overstated the risk of depression associated with commonly prescribed prostate medications (finasteride and dutasteride) in men over age 50 with an enlarged prostate. This overstatement was due to how comparison groups were selected. Doctors should not be overly concerned about depression risk when deciding whether to prescribe these medications.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), such as finasteride and dutasteride, are commonly prescribed for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and androgenetic alopecia (AGA). These medications are used by millions of men annually, with finasteride prescribed to approximately 2.6 million men in the United States in 2022[1]. Due to their long-term use in these chronic conditions, there is growing interest in understanding their potential adverse effects, including impacts on mental health.\n\nThe proposed mechanism linking 5-ARIs to mood disturbances involves inhibition of the conversion of progesterone to dihydroprogestrone (DHP) in the neurosteroid pathway by 5α-reductase. DHP is subsequently metabolized to produce allopregnanolone, acting as a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, exerting anxiolytic and mood-stabilizing effects[2,3]. However, the literature presents conflicting findings on the relationship between 5-ARIs and depression. Early studies, such as Irwig et al., suggested an association between finasteride use and depressive symptoms post therapy[4], often termed \"post-finasteride syndrome\" (PFS), in men treated for AGA. The study was conducted among a subset of 61 men with persistent sexual side effects with self-administrative questionnaire, limiting the generalizability of these findings due to self-selection bias.\n\nLarger cohort studies have since been conducted, producing heterogeneous results[5–9].  Previous meta-analyses[10,11] reported non-significant pooled results but did not give a sufficient explanation for the observed heterogeneity.  To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis examining how control group selection contributes to heterogeneity in the reported association between 5-ARI use and depression risk. We also provide recommendations for selecting an appropriate control group, depending on study design and research questions.",

    "text": "Paper: 5 ARIs Depression\nSection: METHODS\n\n**Search Strategy and Study Eligibility**\n\nThe meta-analysis followed a PROSPERO registered protocol. Two independent reviewers systematically evaluated eligibility of all studies retrieved from Scopus, Embase, and MEDLINE for human studies evaluating depression risk associated with 5-ARI usage from inception to January 2025. We screened the reference lists of the articles and where possible, corresponded with study investigators. Full details of the search strategy are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement materials. References identified from database searches were exported to Covidence. Studies presented as abstracts, case reports, conference proceedings, reviews, animal experiments or duplicate publications were excluded. Studies with insufficient data or inadequate reporting and non-English language studies were also excluded. Each full-text article was assessed independently for final inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.\n\n \n\n**Data Extraction and Quality Assessment**\n\nTwo reviewers independently extracted the following data from each article using a standardized study form: (1) study information – authors, year publication, geographic location, research design, database usage (2) characteristics of participants – mean age, number of exposure, definition of exposure, number of control, definition of control, baseline ascertainment period, mean/median follow-up time, baseline covariates assessment, grace/continuity period, statistical method to control for confounders, and (3) ascertainment of depressive outcomes (number and type of sources of ascertainment). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with studies scoring ≥7 considered high quality. The rationale for the given scores is on eTable 2 of the supplementary materials.  All statistical codes and data will be made publicly available upon publication to promote transparency and reproducibility. The PRSIMA flow chart is given in Figure 1.\n\n**Statistical Analysis**\n\nThe primary effect measure was the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Odds ratios were treated as HRs given the low incidence of depression. When multiple HRs were reported due to violation of PH, the larger HR was selected conservatively. \n\nA random-effects model was used to pool effect sizes, with between-study variance (τ²) estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird method[12].  The Hartung-Knapp adjustment[13] was applied to account for the small number of studies (n=8 effect sizes), improving the robustness of confidence intervals. A random-effects model was selected *a priori* to account for expected clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies, including differences in populations, study designs, and outcome definitions. Between-study heterogeneity[14] was assessed using the I² statistic and Cochran's Q test. I² values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered to represent low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively. \n\nWe specified an *a priori* objective to stratify analyses by control group type (active comparator vs. non-drug users) and 5-ARI agents. Stratification by control group was motivated by literature in pharmacoepidemiology studies[15–17] and stratification by 5-ARI agents was motivated by the difference in molecular weight between dutasteride and finasteride. Dutasteride has larger molecular weight than finasteride 528.539 g/mol-1 vs 372.553 g/mol-1)[18,19], which may limit its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and exert central neurological effects.\n\nWe performed leave-one-out meta-analyses to evaluate the influence of individuals. Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection of funnel plots and formally tested using Egger's test[20]. \n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the 'meta', 'netmeta', and 'metafor' packages. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05 (two-sided).\n\n**Public and patient involvement**\n\nNo patients or members of the public were directly involved in this study as no primary data was collected.",

    "text": "Paper: 5 ARIs Depression\nSection: RESULTS\n\n**Study Characteristics**\n\nFive studies involving a total of 2,517,859 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis (Table 1). These five studies provide eight effect sizes: Garcia-Argibay 2022 (finasteride and dutasteride)[5], Yeon 2022 (combined 5-ARIs) [6], Hagberg 2017 (finasteride and dutasteride) [7], Welk 2017 (finasteride and dutasteride) [8], and Unger 2016 (finasteride)[9]. All were cohort studies, with the exception of Unger et al., which was derived from a preventive randomized controlled trial (RCT). Their NOS scores are given in Table 2.\n\nThree of the cohort studies[6–8] employed a 1–2-year look-back period to minimize prevalent user bias. Most studies included men aged at least 50 years or older, except for Hagberg et al[7], which included younger participants. The studies were conducted across diverse geographical locations, including Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and South Korea.\n\n**Associations between 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and depressive symptoms**\n\nThe pooled analysis estimated a 31% increased risk of depression associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor usage, HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.98 – 1.76 (Figure 2). However, this overall estimate was accompanied by substantial heterogeneity across studies (I² = 95.5%, τ2 = 0.0984, P < 0.0001), indicating considerable variability in treatment effects. There were no significant differences in depression risk between finasteride and dutasteride users - Finasteride HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.51–3.72, I² = 97.4%, τ2 = 0.1541, P < 0.0001 vs Dutasteride HR 1.45, 95% CI 0.51–4.10, I² = 96%, τ2 = 0.1688, P < 0.0001 (Figure 3).\n\nThe leave-one-out sensitivity analysis provided pooled HR ranging from 1.23 to 1.36 with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) spanning from 0.90 to 1.90 (eTable 1). These remained stable and consistent with the original pooled HR of 1.31 (95% CI 0.98 – 1.76), indicating no significant influence from any single study. The persistent high heterogeneity (I² 94.4% to 96.05%, τ² 0.0809 to 0.1164) aligns with the original analysis (I² = 95.5%, τ² = 0.0984, P < 0.0001), suggesting that variability is not driven by an outlier but rather by study-level differences. \n\n**Associations stratified by control groups**\n\nWhen stratified by control group (Figure 4 - excluding the Unger et al. RCT), observational studies comparing 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) to non-drug users showed a significantly increased risk of depression with moderate heterogeneity (HR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.50 - 2.07, I² = 57.7%, τ2 = 0.0635, P < 0.0001). In contrast, studies using active comparator (alpha-blocker/tamsulosin) showed a decreased risk (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.86 – 0.92) with minimal indication for heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 0%, τ2 = 0, p = 0.9711). \n\n**Publication bias**\n\nA funnel plot was generated to assess publication bias (Figure 5). Visual inspection revealed potential asymmetry, with more studies reporting hazard ratios greater than 1 (suggesting increased depression risk with 5-ARIs) and fewer studies with hazard ratios less than 1, particularly among those with smaller standard errors. Egger’s test for small-study effects could not be reliably performed due to the small number of effect sizes (k=8), as the test requires a minimum of 10 studies for adequate power. The observed asymmetry may reflect underlying heterogeneity rather than true publication bias. Nevertheless, this pattern suggests a possible tilt in the evidence toward mild or null effect, as studies with negative results may be underrepresented in the published literature.",

    "text": "Paper: 5 ARIs Depression\nSection: DISCUSSION\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 longitudinal studies involving 2,517,859 patients demonstrated that 5-ARI users had a significantly increased risk of depression compared to non-drug users (HR = 1.61, 95% CI, 1.20 – 2.16) while a decreased risk was observed when compared to alpha blocker users (HR = 0.89, 95% CI, 0.86 – 0.92). In addition, when using alpha blocker users as a control group, the pooled HR had little indication for heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, τ2 = 0, p = 0.9711). Given that most participants in this meta-analysis were aged 50 or older and diagnosed with BPH, alpha-blocker users represent a more appropriate control group than non-drug users, as they better account for the underlying disease burden and age-related risk factors.\n\nWhen investigating side effects related to a drug that is used to treat an active disease, in this case 5-ARIs for active BPH treatment- it is more appropriate to compare against patients receiving other treatments for the same condition (i.e. active comparator[16]). Making comparison against patients with the disease but not taking the medication opens the door for biases by disease burden/indication. For instance, Rahimi-Ardabili et al. [21] observed increased depressive symptoms in patients treated with finasteride; however, the study's single-arm design makes it difficult to determine whether these symptoms arose from the medication or the psychological distress associated with the underlying condition itself. This limitation underscores the necessity of active-comparator designs, which ensure that both groups share a similar disease burden. As demonstrated by the supplementary data from the appendix of Garcia-Argibay et al[5], the risks of depression were lower/non-significant when comparing 5-ARI usage against record AB usage (Finasteride HR 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73 – 0.91) and Dutasteride HR 0.86 (95% CI, 0.70 – 1.02); while the main analysis pointed toward an increased risk of depression associated with record 5-ARIs when comparing to non-drug users (Finasteride HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.47 – 1.76 and Dutasteride HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.43 – 1.97). \n\nThis consistency across studies suggests that 5-ARIs likely do not substantially increase depression risk when accounting for underlying disease burden.  The use of an active-comparator design helps mitigate confounding by indication, as both groups share similar treatment indications (e.g., BPH), thereby reducing bias from unmeasured confounders such as disease severity or treatment-seeking behavior.\n\nOur study further showed that even with propensity score matching, findings of observational treatment studies using non-drug control groups are likely subject to confounding by indication.  This is in-line with previous methodological studies have shown that observational design could replicate RCT results in preventive trials involving healthy populations, but fail to do so in treatment trials where the populations had high degree of disease burden [17,22,23]. \n\nThe substantial disease burden associated with BPH was highlighted in the cross-sectional study by Pietrzyk et al[24], which documented a wide spectrum of BPH-related morbidity.  We did not include estimates from Pietrzyk et al in our analysis due to challenges in interpretation and concerns regarding methodological limitations.  Specifically, the use of stepwise selection procedures for covariates may have inflated the risk of Type I error and compromised the validity of statistical inferences.\n\nIn this context of high disease burden, the Unger et al. [9] study warrants distinct consideration. Unlike the observational cohorts which examined patients receiving treatment for established disease, Unger et al. was a prevention trial conducted in men without prevalent BPH. Consequently, it is inherently less susceptible to confounding by indication, as participants were not selected based on disease severity or treatment-seeking behavior.\n\nHowever, while the study design mitigates confounding, the statistical interpretation requires caution. As a secondary analysis of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, Unger et al. evaluated 20 distinct outcomes. The observed association with depression (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01–1.19, P = .04) was not adjusted for multiple comparisons; standard adjustment would likely render this result non-significant. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory.\n\nWhen comparing this prevention trial evidence to our active-comparator results, a nuanced picture emerges. The protective effect observed in our observational active-comparator analysis (pooled HR 0.89) may reflect residual confounding in the opposite direction—specifically, patients prescribed alpha-blockers often require more frequent clinical contact, due to acute symptoms, than those on 5-ARIs, thereby increasing opportunities for depression diagnosis.\n\nGiven these considerations, we interpret the Unger point estimate (HR 1.10) as potentially the closest approximation to the isolated pharmacological effect of 5-ARIs, free from the confounding of disease burden found in non-user studies and the potential detection bias of active-comparator studies. The modest magnitude of this effect supports our conclusion that any depression risk associated with 5-ARIs is likely minimal.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTaken together, these findings indicate that while 5-ARIs may exert some biological effect on mood—potentially through mechanisms like neuro-steroid modulation—the impact on depression incidence appears to be much smaller than previously reported. \n\nThe risk of depression associated with 5-ARI use for BPH in men aged 50 and older is likely minimal and should not substantially influence prescribing decisions. Observational data with active comparators suggest a 10% reduction in risk, while randomized data from a cancer prevention trial suggest a potential risk increase of approximately 10%. The inflated risk (around 200%) observed in literature stems from inappropriate control group selection in observational studies. Non-user control groups introduce protopathic bias due to differential underlying disease burden, even when propensity score matching is applied. Future studies investigating depression risk in the AGA populations, especially younger ones, should prioritize active comparator designs to mitigate confounding by indication.",

This study aimed to examine the risk of T2DM associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) compared to tamsulosin.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nWe identified nationwide cohorts of new users of finasteride, dutasteride, and tamsulosin without a history of prescriptions for 5-ARIs or tamsulosin within the previous 3 years among patients covered by national health insurance between 2010 to 2020 in South Korea. Patients were free of T2DM and had received at least 90 days of dispensation of the medications. We balanced cohorts on risk factors for T2DM based on age, health insurance status, index year, comorbidities, and co-medications using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting.

These estimates were consistent in lag time analyses and attenuated among patients with good compliance.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis study suggests minimal effects of finasteride and dutasteride on the risk of T2DM when compared with tamsulosin among patients with BPH. \n\n**Keywords:** finasteride, dutasteride, tamsulosin, pharmacoepidemiology",

    "text": "Paper: Hira Study\nSection: INTRODUCTION\n\nFinasteride and dutasteride, both 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), are widely used medications for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In the UK alone, it is estimated that there are 3,600,000 prescriptions for finasteride annually1. Although initially demonstrated to be safe and efficacious through clinical trials2–4, post-marketing authorization studies have recently emerged highlighting a wide range of side effects associated with 5-ARIs. These side effects range from well-recognized problems such as sexual dysfunction5,6 to more recently recognized neuropsychiatric symptoms7 and metabolic disturbances8 associated with long-term use of finasteride. Given the widespread use of these medications, these novel side effects need to be thoroughly investigated to avoid a potential public health hazard. \n\nMultiple epidemiological studies have examined the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in patients taking 5-ARIs8–10, particularly finasteride and dutasteride. This relation was examined because accumulated in vitro observations and small clinical trials have suggested that inhibition of 5-alpha reductase enzymes in men may increase the risk of T2DM by promoting body fat accumulation, reducing insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue via suppression of non-esterified fatty acids, and contributing to liver steatosis11. Nevertheless, the results of epidemiological studies have been heterogeneous, possibly due to methodological differences8–10. For example, a report by Lee *et al*. estimated the risk of new-onset T2DM at approximately 0.72 when comparing 5-ARIs users and non-users in the Taiwanese data9. Using the same database, Wei *et al. *reported a 49% higher risk of new-onset T2DM in 5-ARIs users compared with tamsulosin users8. Methodologically, the earlier study used a non-active comparator, which is susceptible to confounding by indication and healthy user bias. Although the later study used an active comparator (i.e., tamsulosin users), the authors did not mention a specific washout period, which might have introduced prevalent users into the new-user groups. If the effects of 5-ARIs were dose-dependent, including prevalent users could inflate the risk of developing T2DM. Given the popularity and long-term use of 5-ARIs to manage these conditions, their safety is an issue of great interest for both clinical practice and public health.\n\nTherefore, there remains a need for large pharmacoepidemiologic studies with robust methods to replicate previous findings. We aimed to examine the risk of developing T2DM in BPH patients who initiated finasteride/dutasteride monotherapy in comparison to tamsulosin monotherapy based on a large-scale historical cohort of 5-ARIs new users in South Korea.",

    "text": "Paper: Hira Study\nSection: MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n**Data source**\n\nFor the purpose of this study, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) provided healthcare utilization data for all patients with at least one diagnostic code for BPH (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code N40) in primary and/or secondary positions between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020, in South Korea. The data include demographics (age and sex), all inpatient and outpatient claims for healthcare utilization and medications, insurance status (healthcare insurance or medical aid beneficiaries), and mortality data based on treatment results12. Data linkage was performed using de-identified unique identifiers. As such, the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University Health System approved the waiver of informed consent (No. 4-2022-1549).\n\n**Study cohorts**\n\nWe established a historical cohort of new users of finasteride, dutasteride, or tamsulosin for BPH in several steps. First, after applying the 3-year washout period (from January 2010 to December 2012), we identified the first dispensed prescription for finasteride or dutasteride (hereafter collectively referred to as 5-ARIs) or tamsulosin from January 2013 for each patient. The date of the first prescription was set as the index prescription date (follow-up start date). From this cohort, we selected patients with at least one diagnosis code for BPH during the 3-year period prior to the index date. We then excluded patients with a diagnosis code for T2DM (ICD-10, E11) and/or a record of oral antidiabetic medication use during the 3-year period prior to the index date, patients treated with any 5-ARIs or tamsulosin within 3 years before the index date, patients with diagnosis codes for cancer (except for skin cancer; ICD-10, C43 and C44), and patients with diabetes mellitus other than T2DM (ICD-10 codes E10, E12, E13, and E14) during the entire study period. Tamsulosin users were selected as the control group to mitigate potential confounding by indication since both finasteride and dutasteride, as well as tamsulosin, are pharmacological treatments for BPH, ensuring that both groups consisted of individuals with a similar underlying indication for treatment. Furthermore, prior research has shown that tamsulosin users did not have an increased risk of T2DM compared to BPH patients receiving surgical treatment.8\n\nTo ensure that we included patients who adhered to prescriptions and continuously used the drugs of interest, we selected patients with at least 90 dispensed days of one of the study drugs within 180 days from the index prescription. The 90-dispensed-day period was a grace period accounting for pill-cutting, forgetting to fill medications, or late prescriptions. In addition, based on the pharmacokinetics of finasteride and dutasteride, a 6-month period (180 days) should be a sufficient time for 99% of the drugs (5 half-lives) to be excreted from the circulation12,13. Finally, we excluded patients who had a diagnosis of T2DM and/or were using oral diabetic medication within 1 month after the index date. This 1-month period was used as a minimum induction period based on a prior study reporting increased hepatic insulin resistance in men after 3 weeks of treatment with dutasteride14. This is not to be confused with immortal time bias, which could arise from differences in baseline risk due to “selective timeline” induction. We believe that including this minimum induction time would guard our results against long-latent T2DM. Given that finasteride is a selective inhibitor reducing dihydrotestosterone concentrations primarily in the prostate, and dutasteride is a more potent dual inhibitor with systemic effects15, we performed separate analyses for finasteride and dutasteride. Two separate study cohorts, tamsulosin – finasteride and tamsulosin – dutasteride, were created for head-to-head comparisons of monotherapy effects. If a patient had records for both drugs (tamsulosin – finasteride/dutasteride) at their index date or within 1 month of the induction period, they were excluded from the cohort. Otherwise, they entered the study cohorts based on their earliest record and were subsequently censored when they switched or used both drugs.\n\n**Outcome and covariates**\n\nThe endpoint was the incidence of T2DM. Incidence of T2DM was defined as the first record of a primary or secondary diagnosis (ICD-10 code, E11) and/or receipt of oral diabetic agents (Supplementary Table 1) for the first time. Data were censored when the patients presumably stopped using the drug (no new prescription for study drugs within the last day’s supply plus the recorded number of days’ supply plus a 180-day grace period to allow for dose adjustment and irregular use), when they switched to another treatment (e.g., tamsulosin to finasteride or tamsulosin to dutasteride) or from monotherapy to dual therapy, when they had a record of death, or at the end of the study period (December 31, 2020). This study considered the calendar year of the index date, age (modelled by cubic spline), national health insurance status, history of pre-diabetes (identified by ICD-10 code – R73.03), and comorbidities and medications (for the past 1 year prior to the index date) as covariates. The comorbidities and medications are as follows: comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], heart failure, hypertension, dyslipidemia) and medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARB], beta blockers [BB], thiazide diuretics, statins, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and corticosteroids).\n\n**Statistical analysis**\n\n***Main analysis***",

A log-rank test was conducted to investigate the significance of difference in the probability of incidence of type 2 diabetes between cohorts during follow-up. A two-sided p-value <0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Kaplan-Meier curves were fitted in the unweighted population. Using a set of numerous covariates (age at the index date, insurer type at index, calendar year of the index date, history of pre-diabetes, ACEi, ARB, BB, thiazide, statin, corticosteroids, antidepressives, antipsychotics, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, hypertensive disease, dyslipidemia), we predicted the propensity score for each patient in both cohorts. This set of covariates was chosen based on prior literature and clinical experience. To limit the influence of extreme weights on treatment comparison, we applied weight trimming at the 5th and 95th percentiles. We then created a pseudo-population with balanced covariates using stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting (SPITW)16. After confirming that the maximum weight and the mean weights were 1.0 (for both cohorts), which limits the potential for influential patients to bias the results, we assessed the balance of observed covariates across treatment cohorts in the pseudo-population, with absolute SMD <0.1 deemed acceptable. Cox proportional hazards models were then fitted, without controlling for covariates, to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Follow-up time for each patient was calculated as the time from the index date to the end of follow-up. The proportionality assumptions were mildly violated based on Schoenfeld proportionality tests for both cohorts (ρ=0.037, p=0.014 in the finasteride versus tamsulosin cohort; ρ=-0.058, p <0.01 in the dutasteride versus tamsulosin cohort). To address this mild violation, we conducted piecewise Cox models by follow-up intervals (0–2, 2–4, and 4–6 years). These cut points were based on visual inspection of KM curves, which indicated divergence between groups over time as well as clinically interpretable periods, and were confirmed by Schoenfeld’s residual test, which indicated that the proportionality assumption was not violated within each model (Supplementary Table 2). All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020) provided through the HIRA remote big data analysis system (https://ras.hira.or.kr/).\n\n***Sensitivity analysis***\n\nWe conducted two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. First, to account for possible protopathic bias, we applied 1-year and 2-year lag time periods to the weighted populations in both cohorts and computed the adjusted HR using Cox proportional hazards models, without any additional adjustments. Considering that adherence might affect the outcomes, the cohort was stratified as higher adherence (≥70% medication possession ratio [MPR]) and lower adherence (<70% MPR). The MPR threshold was chosen due to its positive effect on BPH symptoms17. Subsequently, Cox proportional hazards model analyses were performed to estimate weighted hazard ratios for each stratum. All sensitivity analyses used weighted populations created by SPITW without any additional adjustments.",

Before weighting, finasteride users were more likely to use thiazide diuretics and statins and to have hypertension and heart failure compared with tamsulosin users. After weighting , all the baseline characteristics of finasteride and tamsulosin users became comparable. A total of 34,874 tamsulosin users and 19,480 dutasteride users were included in the tamsulosin-dutasteride cohort (Table 2). Before weighting, dutasteride users were less likely to use thiazide diuretics and corticosteroids and to have hypertension compared with tamsulosin users. After weighting, all baseline characteristics of dutasteride and tamsulosin users became comparable.\n\n**Main analysis**\n\nForest plots to summary analyses for both cohorts are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2. \n\n***Finasteride – Tamsulosin cohort***\n\nDuring a mean follow-up of 2.9 years (SD 2.3), 2,813 and 5,063 patients with new-onset T2DM were identified in the finasteride and tamsulosin cohorts, respectively (Table 3). The unadjusted incidence of T2DM was 631 per 10,000 person-years in finasteride users and 589 per 10,000 person-years in tamsulosin users. Log-rank test indicated that the cumulative incidence rate of T2DM was higher (p=0.014) in finasteride users compared with tamsulosin users (Figure 3). We found similar crude HR and adjusted HR of 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01–1.11). After stratification by follow-up time (to address the mild violation of the proportionality assumption), the adjusted risk in finasteride users fluctuated (ranging from 2% to 10%), with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.90 to 1.33 (Table 4).\n\n***Dutasteride – Tamsulosin cohort***\n\nDuring a mean follow-up of 2.8 years (SD 2.3), 2,550 and 5,063 patients with new-onset T2DM were identified in the dutasteride and tamsulosin cohorts, respectively (Table 3). The unadjusted incidence of T2DM was 558 per 10,000 person years in dutasteride users and 589 per 10,000 person-years in tamsulosin users. Log-rank test indicated that the cumulative incidence rate of T2DM was not statistically different between dutasteride and tamsulosin users (p=0.48) (Figure 4). We found similar crude HR and adjusted HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.92–1.02). After stratifying the results by follow-up time, the adjusted risk of developing T2DM decreased with longer follow-up times in dutasteride users (ranging from 1.00 to 0.87) compared with tamsulosin users (Table 4). The 95% confidence intervals ranged from 0.71 to 1.08.\n\n**Sensitivity analysis**\n\nOverall, the results from the lag time analysis (Supplementary Table 3 ) did not differ from those of the aggregate main analysis. The adjusted HRs for the finasteride–tamsulosin cohort were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01–1.12) for the 1-year lag and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03–1.12) for the 2-year lag. Similarly, the adjusted HRs for the dutasteride–tamsulosin cohort were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.92–1.03) for the 1-year lag and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92–1.03) for the 2-year lag. Among the study population with good compliance, a downward trend in adjusted HRs was observed in both cohorts: 1.01 (95% CI, 0.95–1.08) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86–0.97) for the finasteride–tamsulosin and dutasteride–tamsulosin cohorts, respectively (Supplementary Table 4 ).",

    "text": "Paper: Hira Study\nSection: DISCUSSION\n\nThis is the first As-Treated (AT) protocol using national data to evaluate the risk of T2DM associated with 5-ARI use. We utilized the active comparator (tamsulosin) and SIPTW to minimize indication bias and confounding. Furthermore, the AT protocol, paired with the 3-year look-back period — the longest baseline ascertainment period reported in the literature on this subject — minimized prevalent-user bias and misclassification of exposure. In the main analysis, finasteride users had a slightly increased risk of T2DM compared with tamsulosin users (HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01–1.11), whereas the risk of T2DM did not significantly differ between dutasteride users and tamsulosin users. In the piecewise Cox analysis and when restricted to patients with good compliance, the risks did not exhibit statistical significance in either cohort.\n\nA previous study demonstrated that BPH patients taking 5-ARIs have around an 18% higher likelihood of developing T2DM than those taking tamsulosin.8 In this previous study, when comparing dutasteride and tamsulosin monotherapy groups matched by propensity score (PS), dutasteride users had an adjusted HR of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.02–1.75) in the UK population and 1.18 (95% CI, 1.00–1.40) in the Taiwanese population. When comparing PS-matched finasteride and tamsulosin monotherapy groups, the adjusted risk of T2DM associated with finasteride use was 1.22-fold (95% CI, 0.95–1.57) and 1.61-fold (95% CI, 1.46–1.80) higher in the UK and Taiwanese data, respectively.8 Their findings suggest that 5-ARi users may be at a higher risk of T2DM compared with tamsulosin users. Our results fall within the range of these confidence intervals. In the present study using the South Korean database, we were able to utilize a larger number of records and apply SIPTW instead of PS matching to preserve our sample size, thereby improving the precision of the 95% confidence intervals. Overall, our study yielded more conservative estimates with overlapping confidence intervals compared with previous studies.8,10 Methodologically, similar to the previous study analyzing UK and Taiwanese data8, we utilized the active comparator (tamsulosin) and the propensity score method to minimize indication bias. Compared with previous studies8–10, the present study applied a stricter definition of drug exposure by censoring data at discontinuation of the drug of interest (defined as the last prescription day plus the duration of supply plus a 180-day grace period). Although this approach excluded patients who developed T2DM after discontinuation from being counted as drug-related events and might have underestimated T2DM incidence, it enabled us to avoid bias due to varying factors influencing T2DM risk after discontinuation of the drug of interest and to maximize the use of real-world data reflecting current clinical practice. This approach allows us to better utilize real-world data, reflecting clinical practice scenarios such as patients forgetting to fill prescriptions and pill cutting.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the risk of T2DM slightly increased in finasteride users but not in dutasteride users in the main analysis, although dutasteride is known to exert more profound systemic suppression of dihydrotestosterone through more potent inhibition of both type I and II 5α-reductase isoforms.18 One possible explanation is lower hepatic expression of type I 5α-reductase activity and the resulting reduction in metabolic impact of dutasteride in East Asian populations.19 In addition, pharmacokinetic differences between the drugs may play a role: dutasteride has a much longer half-life (up to 5 weeks) than finasteride (5–6 hours).12,13 We speculate that more sustained suppression of 5α-reductase activity by dutasteride induces compensatory stabilization of glucose homeostasis. However, the potential impact of unmeasured confounders (e.g., genetic, lifestyle, and healthcare utilization factors) cannot be excluded, and neither finasteride nor dutasteride displayed significant associations with T2DM risk in our piecewise Cox analysis.\n\nClinically, given the minimal impact of 5-ARIs on the incidence of T2DM in our overall findings, there appears to be no compelling evidence to deter the use of 5-ARIs in BPH patients without underlying T2DM due to concerns about the risk of incident T2DM. Moreover, a recent population-based study demonstrated no significant risk of poor glycemic control associated with finasteride compared with tamsulosin use in T2DM patients20. Collectively, the use of 5-ARIs is unlikely to adversely affect glucose metabolism in either non-diabetic or diabetic patients, thereby supporting their safe use in clinical practice. However, it remains possible that specific patient subgroups may be susceptible to the diabetogenic effect of 5-ARIs. Particularly, traditional risk factors for T2DM (e.g., age, pre-diabetes, and cardiometabolic comorbidities) might modify the impact of 5-ARI use on the development of T2DM, which warrants future investigation. In addition, higher doses of 5-ARIs may be associated with an increased risk of T2DM. The present study did not evaluate dose–response relationships because both finasteride and dutasteride are prescribed at fixed doses in BPH treatment. Future studies may be needed to explore the dose–response relationship in male pattern hair loss, in which the treatment doses for finasteride and dutasteride vary.",

    "text": "Paper: Hira Study\nSection: DISCUSSION (cont.)\n\nOverall, this study demonstrated a modest to null effect of 5-ARIs on the risk of T2DM. However, it is necessary to interpret our results in the face of several limitations. First, we identified the incidence of T2DM based on diagnostic codes and prescriptions in routinely collected healthcare utilization data, although the same limitation applies to previous studies8–10. Second, given that T2DM patients develop hyperglycemia before diagnosis of T2DM and that hyperglycemia is associated with increased prostate size (the indication of 5-ARis)21, patients who first received finasteride might have potential protopathic bias. To address this potential bias, we conducted a sensitivity analysis applying lag times between drug prescription and the incidence of T2DM and found similar risk estimates to the main results. Third, although we had several thousand individuals with more than 6 years of follow-up (Table 4), the average follow-up time was approximately 3 years, which mirrored the duration of drug exposure because the data were censored when treatment was switched, stopped, or augmented. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility of an increase in the risk of T2DM related to longer use of 5-ARis. Fourth, our findings may not be generalizable to other countries with different ethnic compositions and healthcare systems. Fifth, our results may be affected by patients’ compliance. We attempted to address this by conducting a sensitivity analysis on a subgroup of patients who had an MPR ≥70%. The results from this sensitivity analysis corroborated the minimal effects of 5-ARIs on the risk of T2DM, with the adjusted HRs for both finasteride and dutasteride showing a downward trajectory.\n\nDue to the nature of the data source, there is a possibility of unmeasured confounders such as body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. In the previous study8, the UK data analysis adjusted for body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption exhibited similar risk estimates to the Taiwanese data analysis that did not adjust for these factors. In addition, according to the American Urological Association, drug initiation may not depend on these factors22. Finally, a small number of patients who received insulin without oral hypoglycemic agents may have been included. Given the lack of oral therapy and potential etiologies other than T2DM, the inclusion of such individuals may have introduced potential misclassification bias. \n\nIn conclusion, this historical cohort study using nationwide primary-to-tertiary healthcare utilization data linked with prescription data found minimal effects of finasteride and dutasteride on the risk of T2DM compared with tamsulosin. This study may provide robust evidence regarding the risk of T2DM associated with the use of 5-ARIs among BPH patients.\n\n**Table 1.

After applying inverse probability treatment weighting, tamsulosin users were not at a significantly higher risk of poor glycemic control compared with finasteride users (weighted hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.72).

    "text": "Paper: NZ Study\nSection: INTRODUCTION\n\n# Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common urological problems in men. The global prevalence of BPH increased from 51.1 million cases in 2000 to 94 million cases in 2019. In addition, its heavy burden is also projected to increase [1], which emphasizing the need for an effective management strategy for this condition. Recent studies have shown an association of prostate enlargement with elevated fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels [2,3], which may be explained by biological mechanisms, including sex steroid metabolism, systematic inflammation, and insulin-like growth factor activity [4]. Two large, high-quality studies [5,6] and a meta-analysis [7] have linked hyperglycemia to more severe lower urinary tract symptoms in BPH patients. Given the consequence of the link between prostate enlargement and glucose metabolism, glycemic status is an important factor to consider in BPH management.\n\n# Studies have explored the effect of BPH medications on glucose metabolism; however, their findings are mixed. An animal study found 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARis) influenced glucocorticoid metabolism by reducing the levels of androgen dihydrotestosterone, consequently inducing steatotic liver disease and hepatic insulin resistance [8]. Similar effects have been observed in humans. For example, a meta-analysis reported an association between androgen deprivation therapy and increased risk of diabetes mellitus [9]. A randomized controlled study involving 46 BPH patients found a decrease in hepatic insulin sensitivity among BPH patients on dutasteride, a 5-ARi [10]. The same mixed findings also appeared in investigations involving the alpha-blocker drug class. A single-arm clinical trial found favorable effects of doxazosin, a non-specific alpha-blocker, on glycemic control in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [11]. Conversely, a recent case series showed tamsulosin, a uroselective alpha-blocker, may induce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM [12,13]. These inconsistent findings underscore the need for further investigation by large-scale pharmaco-epidemiological studies. Two such studies have been published, though they produced conflicting results despite using similar databases [14,15]. Both studies compared the risk of developing T2DM in BPH patients who took 5-ARis versus those who did not. The earlier study, which drew data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, found finasteride—a 5-ARi—decreased the risk of developing T2DM [14]. By contrast, the latter study, which utilized both the National Health Insurance Research Database and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, showed finasteride increased the risk of T2DM [15]. Notably, neither study used a lag period to address protopathic bias, which refers to reverse associations between drug exposure and development of a disease or condition. \n\n# Furthermore, it remains unclear whether BPH medications impact glycemic control in patients with T2DM. To date, no real-world pharmaco-epidemiological study has been conducted to compare the effects of finasteride and tamsulosin use on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. This nationwide population-based cohort study aimed to compare the incidence of poor glycemic control between finasteride and tamsulosin users with T2DM.",

    "text": "Paper: NZ Study\nSection: PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS\n\n**Data source**\n\nAll data were sourced from the New Zealand Ministry of Health national collections between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2017. Information on demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity), diagnosis date, and diagnosis code (based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, tenth edition [ICD-10]) was sourced from the National Minimum Dataset (hospital event data) [16]. The hospital event data were then linked with Pharmaceutical Dispensing data, which contains claim and payment information from pharmacists, and mortality data using the encrypted National Health Index number—a unique identifier assigned to every person who utilizes health and disability services in New Zealand. \n\n**Study cohort**\n\nWe used an active-comparator, new-user design to construct a cohort of men who were admitted for T2DM (ICD-10, E11) and then received either tamsulosin or finasteride treatment (Figure 1). To increase the likelihood that selected patients indeed had T2DM, we further restricted our cohort to those who received at least 1 prescription for any oral diabetic medications during the study period following their admission with T2DM. Our search algorithm includes all nationally insured oral diabetic medications in New Zealand during the study period, which are metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, pioglitazone and acarbose. To identify new-user of the interest drugs, a 2-year wash-out period was applied, and patients required to have at least of 1-year of record pharmaceutical dispensing data to enter the study. For a head-to-head comparison between finasteride monotherapy and tamsulosin monotherapy, we identified the first date of the finasteride or tamsulosin prescription (set as the index date) after 31 December 2007. We excluded 1) patients who had ICD-10 codes for other types of diabetes ( E10, E12, E13, and E14), 2) patients who received an insulin prescription prior to the index date, 3) patients who switched from finasteride to tamsulosin or vice versa, 4) patients who received both tamsulosin and finasteride during the follow-up period, 5) patients with any cancer diagnosis during the study duration using relevant ICD-10 codes (C00–C97), and 6) patients who received fewer than three prescriptions for tamsulosin or finasteride. \n\n**Outcome and covariates**\n\nThe outcome was the first insulin prescription, as a proxy for poor glycemic control [17], during the follow-up period. Follow-up ended at the occurrence of the outcome, death, or 31 December 2017, whichever came first. We considered the following potential confounders: age at the index date, ethnicity, T2DM’s medications (our patients only have record for metformin and sulfonylurea), duration of T2DM (from the first record of T2DM in the database to the index date), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI; using ICD-10 codes in the 5 years prior to the index date), and use of other drugs affecting glycemic control, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics, statins, and beta-blockers. In New Zealand, T2DM patients of some ethnicities have been reported to have poorer health outcomes than the majority ethnicity [18,19]. The ethnic groups were categorized as Europeans, Indigenous people, Asians, and Others (including not recorded) based on the codes provided by the New Zealand health ministry [20]. The baseline covariates were taken within one year prior to the index date unless stated otherwise. \n\n**Statistical analyses**\n\n***Main analysis***\n\nA log-rank test was conducted to investigate the significance of the difference in the probability of poor glycemic control between finasteride and tamsulosin users during the follow-up period. A Kaplan-Meier curve was fitted on the unweighted population. We first estimated the crude hazard ratio between tamsulosin and finasteride, without any covariates. A 95% confidence interval was used to account for uncertainty of the estimates and absolute difference less than 0.1 is deemed as suitable. Subsequently, we built a Cox proportional hazard model including the above covariates (age at the index date, ethnicity, T2DM’s medications, duration of T2DM, CCI, and use of ACEis, ARBs, diuretics, statins, and beta-blockers) and estimated adjusted hazard ratio (adjusted HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The follow-up time for each patient was calculated as the time from the index date to the end of the follow-up period. The proportionality assumptions were not violated based on Schoenfeld proportionality tests. To address indication bias, we conducted inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW). We first constructed a logistic regression model to obtain a propensity score for each patient using the same covariates in the adjusted HR; and then applied IPTW using the propensity scores to create a weighted population with balanced covariates. Extreme weights were removed with 1% and 99% quantile weight trimming. We evaluated baseline covariates using the absolute standardized difference, cumulative distribution functions, and box plots (Figures S1–3). Absolute standardized differences smaller than 0.10 were considered acceptable [21]. A Cox proportional hazard model was fitted after IPTW without including any covariates. Statistical analyses were carried out using Python 3.9.12 and RStudio (4.3.2).\n\n***Sensitivity analysis***",

    "text": "Paper: NZ Study\nSection: PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS (cont.)\n\nWe conducted two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. First, to address protopathic bias and indication bias, we performed a delayed event analysis with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month lag periods. These lag periods were chosen because 5-ARis may disrupt glucose metabolism between 3 weeks and 3 months from initiation [10,22]. In addition, given the uncertainties in the time between worsening glycemic control and the first insulin prescription, we extended the exposure lag period to 12 months. This 12-month lag period was chosen because an average of 1 year can elapse before providers intensify treatment for patients with poor glycemic control [23]. Patients displaying the event of interest before the lag periods were likely influenced by protopathic bias. In the context of protopathic bias, tamsulosin is often used to manage frequent micturition [24,25], which could signal worsening of underlying diabetic symptoms. In this analysis, patients who received insulin during the lag periods were re-classified as non-event.\n\nFor the second sensitivity analysis, considering that patients with multiple comorbidities are more likely to receive insulin for glycemic control [26], the cohort was stratified into a low CCI stratum (i.e., patients with lower than or equal to the median CCI score of 9.0) and a high CCI stratum (i.e., patients with a CCI score higher than the median). Subsequently, IPTW using propensity score was applied as detailed above to create pseudo-population; and Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to estimate a weighted HR for each stratum. All sensitivity analyses were carried out using pseudo-population.\n\nETHICS AND CONSENT\n\nEthics approval was waived because we obtained de-identified raw data from New Zealand Ministry of Health national collections for research purpose (https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/for-health-professionals/data-and-statistics/nz-health-statistics/national-collections-and-surveys/collections/national-minimum-dataset-hospital-events).

At baseline, the tamsulosin group had a lower mean CCI score, and was more likely to use ARBs and statin while less likely to use ACEis, compared with the finasteride group (Table 1). After applying IPTW, all the absolute standardized differences in covariates were less than 0.10.\n\n**Risk of poor glycemic control in tamsulosin versus finasteride users**\n\nDuring a median follow-up of 2.44 years for finasteride users and 1.61 years for tamsulosin users, we noted 221 new insulin prescriptions (154 finasteride users and 67 tamsulosin users). The incidence rates were 564 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI, 429–700) and 409 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI, 344–474) in tamsulosin users and finasteride users, respectively (Table 2). The free-insulin prescription probability was lower in the tamsulosin cohort compared with the finasteride cohort (p = 0.068 from the log-rank test). The curve showed a rapid divergence after treatment initiation (Figure 2). Tamsulosin users had a higher insulin prescription rate compared with finasteride users, although this increased risk was not statistically significant (adjusted HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.92–1.66). After IPTW, a similar risk of receiving an insulin prescription was observed in tamsulosin users versus finasteride users (weighted HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.95–1.72).\n\n**Sensitivity analyses**\n\nWith each successive application of lag periods, the risk of receiving an insulin prescription associated with tamsulosin monotherapy versus finasteride monotherapy gradually decreased. In weighted populations, the risks of receiving an insulin prescription were 24%, 26%, 23%, and 15% higher in tamsulosin users compared with finasteride users when applying 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month lag periods, respectively (Table S1). The risks were not statistically significant. In the CCI-stratified analyses, the insulin prescription risks associated with tamsulosin monotherapy versus finasteride monotherapy were elevated by 34% and 20% for the lower stratum and higher stratum, respectively (Figure 3; Table S2).",

    "text": "Paper: NZ Study\nSection: DISCUSSION\n\nThis nationwide population-based cohort study estimated the risk of insulin prescription (as a proxy for poor glycemic control) in tamsulosin users compared with finasteride users among individuals with T2DM. While there are controversies surrounding the relationship between 5-ARis and the heightened risk of T2DM, our study adds to current evidence on the effect of BPH medication on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. In our main analysis, tamsulosin users were at a higher risk of poor glycemic control compared with finasteride users (HR=1.23), but this risk did not reach statistical significance. Additional analyses addressing indication bias (IPTW using propensity scores) and protopathic bias (applying lag periods at 3-month intervals, ranging from 3 to 12 months) demonstrated similar risks.\n\nConsidered alongside the previous findings, our results suggest the effect of BPH medications on glycemic control may be dynamic with various pathways. Although earlier studies have not unequivocally established the causality between 5-ARis and worsening glycemic control (leading to the development of T2DM), a considerable body of evidence suggests use of 5-ARis may reduce insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic individuals via steatotic liver disease [8–10,15]. The persistent trend of elevation of insulin prescription risk in the tamsulosin group in the present study suggests tamsulosin might contribute to the worsening of glycemic control in patients with established T2DM. Studies on non-insulin-dependent glucose metabolism pathways in human adipose tissue [27,28] have shown inhibition of alpha receptors (by alpha receptor blockers) decreases glucose uptake and therefore worsens glycemic control. In the present study, the hazard rate of poor glycemic control was higher in tamsulosin users than that in finasteride users, among individuals with T2DM. The possibility that tamsulosin exacerbate glycemic control in T2DM patients with excess adipose tissue appeared in a few case reports. Four T2DM patients with well-controlled blood glucose developed hyperglycemia within 48 hours of taking tamsulosin; the patients’ blood glucose levels more than doubled after tamsulosin initiation and decreased to normal levels after discontinuing tamsulosin, and all other possible causes of hyperglycemia were ruled out [13]. \n\nThe present study may have clinical implications regarding the use of BPH medications in patients with T2DM. Previous real-world evidence from the UK and Canada suggests 5-ARi users may increase the risk of developing T2DM compared with tamsulosin users in BPH patients with normoglycemia [15,29]. It should note that the latter study did not found a dose-response relationship in 5-ARi users [29].  In this study, the results demonstrated no significant difference in the risk of poor glycemic control between finasteride users and tamsulosin users, with increasing following up time, among patients with T2DM. This suggesting that 5-ARis and tamsulosin may not differentially affect glycemia after T2DM develops. We attempted to address the indication bias due to the different patient characteristics related to finasteride and tamsulosin prescriptions using IPTW with propensity scores, which yielded similar risks. One could also argue that protopathic bias or reverse causation may affect the risk of receiving an insulin prescription in the tamsulosin group versus the finasteride group. However, our additional analyses using 3- to 12-month lag periods, with 3-month intervals, displayed similar risk estimates. Furthermore, the effect of protopathic bias may be minimal because poor glycemic status exacerbates BPH [30,31] and patients with severe BPH are more likely to receive finasteride over tamsulosin. Hence, our findings suggest that, over the long-term in T2DM patients, finasteride users may not experience more hyperglycemia episodes than if they’d had been put on tamsulosin. However, there could be an elevation of risk during the initial phase of tamsulosin in new users with T2DM.",

    "text": "Paper: NZ Study\nSection: DISCUSSION (cont.)\n\nThis study has several limitations to be acknowledged. First, first prescription of insulin was used as a surrogate endpoint for poor glycemic control. This approach may have underestimated the number of individuals with poor glycemic control because it did not consider changing the regimen from monotherapy of metformin to combination therapy with other oral anti-diabetic medications as poor glycemic control. During the study period from 2006 to 2017, relatively new oral anti-diabetic medications (e.g., dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) were not introduced or publicly funded in New Zealand. Insulin has been recommended as an initial treatment for severe hyperglycemia and a third-line treatment for uncontrolled T2DM after combination therapy [35]. Because these indications of insulin prescriptions are based on the level of hemoglobin A1c, insulin use may be a useful proxy for poor glycemic control in studies using pharmaceutical dispensing data. Second, we used hospital discharge data to identify individuals with T2DM. This means that we captured more severe cases of T2DM, possibly with comorbidities. To address the potential effect of comorbidity on the studied associations, we estimated the risk of receiving an insulin prescription associated with tamsulosin use versus finasteride use after stratification by CCI score. The risk remained elevated in both the low and high strata of CCI score. Fourth, there may be unmeasured confounders. For example, we did not include other possible hyperglycemia-inducing drugs (such as corticosteroids, second-generation antipsychotics, protease inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors) in the study because our patients did not have a record (protease inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors) or a very small number of patients were on them (second-generation antipsychotic and corticosteroids). Another example is socioeconomic status, as low socioeconomic status is associated with more severe symptoms of BPH [32] as well as poor glycemic control [33,34]. Although we used ethnicity as a covariate to control for socioeconomic status, the social deprivation index may be useful as another covariate to include in the model. Lastly, the prescription data only included drugs publicly funded in New Zealand. Our study cohort started from 2008 to the end of 2017. Although tamsulosin was not publicly funded until August 2010, we applied the same time period to the finasteride and tamsulosin cohorts (from January 2008). This may not have distorted our results as we used the dynamic cohort design\n\nIn conclusion, the present study showed that finasteride users and tamsulosin users had similar risks of poor glycemic control with long-term usage of these drugs among individuals with T2DM.  Nevertheless, there could be an increased risk during initiation of tamsulosin in BPH-treatment naïve patients with T2DM. Further studies with longer follow-up time and larger sample size are required to confirm these associations.\n\nDECLARATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Dr Jeffrey C.H.
